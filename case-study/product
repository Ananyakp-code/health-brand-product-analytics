Exploratory Analysis (Excel)
Initial exploration in Excel showed:
•	Balanced acquisition across channels
•	Apple Cider Vinegar as top revenue driver
•	51.8% repeat purchase rate
•	Funnel inconsistencies with later stages sometimes exceeding earlier ones
This indicated the need for a time-based funnel analysis in SQL to get accurate conversion metrics.
